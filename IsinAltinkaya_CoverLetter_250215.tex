Dear Hiring Committee,\\
\vskip 0.2in

I am writing to express my interest in the Genomics Data Analyst position at the SNSB Genomics Core Facility. With a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Computational Evolutionary Genomics from the Geogenetics Section at the Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen (expected March 2025), I have developed a strong foundation in computational biology, scientific software development, and developing efficient computational pipelines for high-performance computing. I am eager to apply my expertise to support the SNSB's mission of advancing geo- and biodiversity research.

\medskip

As a Ph.D. researcher, I have developed advanced algorithms and software to analyze NGS data and gain meaningful evolutionary and population genetic insights, with a focus on efficiency and scalability. Notably, I authored several publications where I implement advanced statistical methods into fast, efficient and user-friendly software. I believe my academic research output exemplifies my ability to design robust computational solutions addressing genomic data complexities. My technical expertise includes C, C++, Python, R and Bash, as well as experience with Linux/Unix environments. I have extensive experience in developing workflows and tools for sequence data analysis, utilizing container technologies such as Docker and workflow engines such as Nextflow and Snakemake.

\medskip

At the GeoGenetics Center, I had the opportunity to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, which resulted in multiple high-impact publications and has honed my ability to derive biological insights from data. I played a key role in the development and optimization of the main bioinformatics pipeline, which processed large-scale raw NGS data. This experience allowed me to work extensively with quality control and population genomic analyses, ensuring that genomic analyses were both accurate and efficient. I also collaborated closely with the technical team at Illumina and worked with raw data to integrate new sequencing technologies into our workflows. This hands-on experience with cutting-edge sequencing technologies, pipeline development, and interdisciplinary collaboration has equipped me with the skills to tackle complex genomic challenges and drive innovation in phylogenomic and evolutionary research.

\medskip

My passion for phylogenomics stems from my deep interest in reconstructing evolutionary relationships and understanding the genomic architecture of species through high-throughput sequencing data. During my PhD, I developed ngsAMOVA, a probabilistic framework for molecular variance analysis, phylogenetic tree construction, and dXY estimation from low-depth sequencing data During my undergraduate studies, I conducted an internship at the Biogeography Research Lab, where I developed a Snakemake pipeline for phylogenomic analyses of the Noccaea species complex. This experience allowed me to gain hands-on expertise with modern phylogenomic tools such as RAxML, IQ-TREE, ASTRAL, and BEAST, enabling me to tackle complex questions in evolutionary relationships, species divergence, and phylogenetic reconstruction. Additionally, I attended a RevBayes workshop, where I gained experience in tree inference from molecular data, evaluating MCMC performance, assessing model adequacy, and conducting macroevolutionary analyses.

\medskip

My expertise goes beyond merely utilizing existing tools; I have actively designed and implemented novel algorithms and frameworks to address the intricate challenges of genomic data analysis, ensuring both precision and computational efficiency. This experience has provided me with a deep understanding of the complexities inherent in bioinformatics, enabling me to critically assess data, optimize analytical workflows, and rigorously evaluate results.

\medskip

Additionally, I studied German as my secondary foreign language during high school, which provided me with a foundational understanding of the language. While I am not yet at a conversational level, I am highly motivated to improve my German proficiency and am committed to developing my language skills further. I am confident that within a short period, I can reach a level where I can also communicate in German at work. I am eager to immerse myself in a German-speaking environment and take advantage of opportunities to enhance my fluency.

\medskip

I would like to disclose that I have a disability that is classified as a severe disability under German law. I have attached the relevant documentation as proof of my degree of disability. However, this does not impact my dedication or ability to excel in my professional role. I am fully committed to performing at the highest level in my professional role and have consistently demonstrated my ability to contribute effectively in research and computational projects.

\medskip

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of the SNSB Genomics Core Facility.
